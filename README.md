## GOP Twitter Derby


#### What is this?

[A site](http://gop.bsouth.ga) to watch the twitterverse rage about the repubs in real time!

#### How does it do that?

Pretty basic, I open a [garden hose](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public)
thread that watches the full names of candidates for mentions on twitter.

#### Just the full names? That doesn't seem very scientific!

Nope.
